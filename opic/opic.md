## 오픽 Rule

1. Never ask Ava a question. If you must, ask a rhetorical question.

   질문하는거는거 보다는, 인정하는것이 더 좋다(수사적 질문하지 말것 )

2. Do not use diffcult words tht you are uncomfortable with. Use simple words you are totally confident in using!

   어려운 단어 쓰지말고 내가 자신있게 말하기 좋은 간단한 단어 사용하기

3. Try not to repeat the same word in the same sentence.

   같은 문장에서 같은 단어 쓰지 않기

4. Don't use 2 descriptive or feeling words using "and"!

   Cozy and comfy보단 나눠서 설명하기(my room is just comfy. It mean it's jist so cozy)

5. Talk about one thing, and one thing only!

   한가이제 대해서만 얘기하기. 짧아도 깔끔하게 좋음 다른거 말하지 말 것

6. That's all. 이라고 끝내지 말기

7. Make 'honest excuses' later. Not in the beginning!

   솔직한 변명은 나중에 하자. 맨 처음에 말하지 말자

8. 



## 전략

1.  comparison stragey
   - 잘 비교하지 못할꺼면 하나만 확실하게 하자(아예 언급 x)

## 좋은 표현

i thing

i have no choice but

um, as i already told you before

I mean, don't get me wrong(오해하진마)
